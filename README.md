# fin-proj
Final Project
This program reads in names from a "names.txt" file (one name per line) and eventually outputs them in randomized pairs. 
It first puts all the names into a linked list. Then it randomly calls nodes of that list, places them, in a new order, in a second circularly linked list and deletes the node from list 1.
By having it be a circular list, the program works just as well for even and odd numbers of names. 
The output displays all names at once (for the programmer beneift) and then can be navigated name by name to access that person's partner (for the market use).
